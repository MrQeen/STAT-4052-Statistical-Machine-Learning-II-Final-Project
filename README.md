# STAT-4052-Statistical-Machine-Learning-II-Final-Project
This is the final project for STAT 4052 Statistical Machine learning II from UMN. 

The data analysis project on heart disease aims to identify the factors that have the  most impact on heart attacks
This project utilized two different imputation methods to address missing values: simple imputation that drops NAs and iterative regression imputation that fills NAs with different regression methods based on the variable type.
Then, Logistic Regression, KNN, and RandomForest are used to identify the key factors in the imputed data. The accuracy of these methods on two sets of imputation data is compared and discussed.
